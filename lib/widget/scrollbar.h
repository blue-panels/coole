 * A scrollbar: an arrow at each end, a track between them and a thumb in the track.  It shows a
 * view of visible of total at pos, and moves it with the mouse: an arrow steps, the track beside
 * the thumb pages, the thumb is dragged.  Each move is told to the client of the bar, the owner
 * when it has none, by MSG_NOTIFY with the bar as the sender; scrollbar_get_pos() is where the
 * view is asked to go.  The client moves the view there, or as near as it can, and gives the bar
 * the range again.  A bar takes no focus and no keys; it draws nothing while the view holds all
 * of the text.
